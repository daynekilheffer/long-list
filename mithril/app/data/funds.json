The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by: <UL><LI><strong>Stock market risk: </strong>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks.

Companies that issue convertible securities are often small to medium size, and they often have low credit ratings. In addition, the credit rating of a company&#8217;s convertible securities is generally lower than that of its non-convertible debt securities. Convertibles are normally considered &#8220;junior&#8221; securities&#8212;that is, the company usually must pay interest on its non-convertible debt before it can make payments on its convertible securities. If an issuer stops making interest or principal payments, these securities may be worthless and the fund could lose its entire investment. Reflecting the universe of convertible securities, most of the fund&#8217;s rated holdings are below investment-grade.</LI><LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.</LI><LI><strong>Country/regional risk: </strong>The&#160;chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions.

Redemptions from a shareholder account will proportionately reduce the amount of future cash distributions received on the account.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk:</strong> The chance that investment selections and/or asset allocation decisions by the advisor will cause the fund to fail to achieve its objective or to generate lower returns than were possible from different investment selections and/or asset allocation decisions.</li> <li><strong>Stock risk:</strong> Includes the chance that stock prices overall will decline, that changes in currency exchange rates will cause investments in foreign stocks to decrease in value, that world events will adversely affect the value of foreign securities, and that emerging markets will experience substantially more volatility and illiquidity than developed markets. Also includes REIT stock risks associated with the real estate industry.</li> <li><strong>Bond risk:</strong> Includes the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates or that the underlying fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates, that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, that issuers will recall higher-coupon securities before maturity, and that corporate fixed income securities will suffer a substantial decline in credit quality and market value because of a corporate restructuring.</li> <li><strong>Inflation-linked investment risk:</strong> The fund may invest in Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund (and/or other Vanguard inflation-protected securities funds) to capture the investment returns of inflation-indexed securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and corporations.</li> <li><strong>Commodity-linked investment risk:</strong> Includes the chance that investments in commodity futures, structured notes, and derivatives could experience large losses resulting from even small movements in market prices.</li> <li><strong>Market-neutral investment risk:</strong> Includes the chance that the long/short market-neutral strategy used by the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund will not succeed, that the fund will lose money in connection with short sales, and that returns will trail relevant benchmarks or similar funds.</li> <li><strong>Risks of prospective absolute return fund:</strong> Expected to include the risk of a total loss of the entire amount invested, the risk that returns from a leveraged instrument will be more volatile than returns from the underlying investment and that leveraged losses will exceed the principal amount invested.</li> <li><strong>Currency hedging risk:</strong> The risk that the currency hedging transactions entered into by an underlying fund may not perfectly offset the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposure. For example, the fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar.</li> </ul> <UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Managed Payout Composite Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"0.96","rSquaredPrimary":"0.96","betaBroadBased":"0.55","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.84"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/mf/month-end/1498","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00","price":"16.46","priceChangeAmount":"0.12","priceChangePct":"0.73"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"1.83","hasDisclaimer":true,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"B","footnoteText":" BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"-4.68"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2008-05-02T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Managed Payout Fund      ","benchmarkShortName":"Managed Payout Composite Index                    ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"1498","name":"Managed Payout Fund      ","calendarYTDPct":"-2.25","prevMonthPct":"-2.25","threeMonthPct":"-3.99","oneYrPct":"-2.85","threeYrPct":"4.84","fiveYrPct":"5.58","sinceInceptionPct":"3.76"},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"11857","name":"Managed Payout Composite Index                    ","calendarYTDPct":"-3.28","prevMonthPct":"-3.28","threeMonthPct":"-5.19","oneYrPct":"-4.70","threeYrPct":"3.24","fiveYrPct":"4.18","sinceInceptionPct":"2.66"}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"0040","ticker":"VFINX","shortName":"500 Index Fund Inv","longName":"Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares","cusip":"922908108","inceptionDate":"1976-08-31T00:00:00-04:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"500                 ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"Domestic Stock - General","category":"Large Blend","customizedStyle":"Stock - Large-Cap Blend","equityInvestmentStyleId":"2","equityInvestmentStyleName":"Large-cap blend","expenseRatio":"0.1700","expenseRatioAsOfDate":"2015-04-28T00:00:00-04:00","isInternalFund":true,"isExternalFund":false,"isMutualFund":true,"isETF":false,"isVLIP":false,"isVVAP":false,"is529":false,"hasAssociatedInvestorFund":true,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":true,"fundFact":{"isActiveFund":true,"isClosed":false,"isClosedToNewInvestors":false,"isFundOfFunds":false,"isMSCIIndexedFund":false,"isIndex":true,"isLoadFund":false,"isMoneyMarket":false,"isBond":false,"isBalanced":false,"isStock":true,"isInternational":false,"isMarketNeutralFund":false,"isInternationalStockFund":false,"isInternationalBalancedFund":false,"isDomesticStockFund":true,"isTaxable":true,"isTaxExempt":false,"isTaxManaged":false,"isTaxableBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptMoneyMarketFund":false,"isTaxSensitiveFund":false,"isSpecialtyStockFund":false,"isHybridFund":false,"isGlobal":false,"isManagedPayoutFund":false,"isGNMAFund":false,"isInvestorShare":true,"isAdmiralShare":false,"isInstitutionalShare":false,"isAdmiralFund":false,"isStableValueFund":false,"isCompanyStockFund":false,"isREITFund":false,"isVariableInsuranceFund":false,"isComingledTrustFund":false,"isConvertibleFund":false,"isAssetAllocationFund":false,"isStateMunicipalBond":false,"isNationalMunicipalBond":false,"isQualifiedOnly":false,"isPreciousMetalsFund":false,"mIsVIPSFund":false,"isSectorSpecific":false,"hasOtherIndex":false,"isTargetRetirementFund":false,"isRetirementSavingsTrustFund":false,"isNon40ActFund":false,"isUnfundedFund":false,"isCreditSuisseFund":false,"isKaiserFund":false,"isFundAccessFund":false,"isFundTransferableToVGI":false,"hasTransactionFee":false,"isNTFFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":true},"associatedFundIds":{"investorFundId":"0040","admiralFundId":"0540","etfFundId":"0968"},"fundCategory":{"customizedHighCategoryName":"Stock - Large-Cap Blend","high":{"type":"HIGH","id":1,"name":"Stock Funds"},"mid":{"type":"MID","id":11,"name":"Domestic Stock - General"},"low":{"type":"LOW","id":1102,"name":"Large Blend"}}},"minimum":{"general":{"name":"General Account","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"ira":{"name":"IRA","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"ugma":{"name":"UGMA/UTMA","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"esa":{"name":"Education savings account","initial":"2000","additional":"1"}},"risk":{"code":4,"level":"Moderate to Aggressive","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks.

Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in a certain sector, the fund&#8217;s performance largely depends&#8212;for better or for worse&#8212;on the general condition of that sector.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual funds.</LI><LI><strong>Investment style risk: </strong>The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</LI></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Spliced U.S. Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"1.00","rSquaredPrimary":"1.00","betaBroadBased":"0.29","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.05"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/mf/month-end/5489","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00","price":"49.51","priceChangeAmount":"-0.14","priceChangePct":"-0.28"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"3.49","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"B","footnoteText":" BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"5.07"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2004-04-28T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Utilities Index Fund Adm ","benchmarkShortName":"Spliced US IMI Utilities 25/50                    ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"5489","name":"Utilities Index Fund Adm ","calendarYTDPct":"4.69","prevMonthPct":"4.69","threeMonthPct":"4.68","oneYrPct":"-2.48","threeYrPct":"11.41","fiveYrPct":"11.68","tenYrPct":"7.66","sinceInceptionPct":"9.70"},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2016-01-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"22273","name":"Spliced US IMI Utilities 25/50                    ","calendarYTDPct":"4.70","prevMonthPct":"4.70","threeMonthPct":"4.71","oneYrPct":"-2.46","threeYrPct":"11.51","fiveYrPct":"11.80","tenYrPct":"7.84","sinceInceptionPct":"9.90"}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"1397","ticker":"VDVIX","shortName":"Developed Markets Idx Inv","longName":"Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund Investor Shares","cusip":"92206J107","inceptionDate":"2013-12-19T00:00:00-05:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"TxMInInv            ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"International/Global Stock","category":"Foreign Large Blend","customizedStyle":"International","expenseRatio":"0.2000","expenseRatioAsOfDate":"2015-04-29T00:00:00-04:00","isInternalFund":true,"isExternalFund":false,"isMutualFund":true,"isETF":false,"isVLIP":false,"isVVAP":false,"is529":false,"hasAssociatedInvestorFund":true,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":true,"fundFact":{"isActiveFund":true,"isClosed":false,"isClosedToNewInvestors":false,"isFundOfFunds":false,"isMSCIIndexedFund":false,"isIndex":true,"isLoadFund":false,"isMoneyMarket":false,"isBond":false,"isBalanced":false,"isStock":true,"isInternational":true,"isMarketNeutralFund":false,"isInternationalStockFund":true,"isInternationalBalancedFund":false,"isDomesticStockFund":false,"isTaxable":true,"isTaxExempt":false,"isTaxManaged":false,"isTaxableBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptMoneyMarketFund":false,"isTaxSensitiveFund":false,"isSpecialtyStockFund":false,"isHybridFund":false,"isGlobal":false,"isManagedPayoutFund":false,"isGNMAFund":false,"isInvestorShare":true,"isAdmiralShare":false,"isInstitutionalShare":false,"isAdmiralFund":false,"isStableValueFund":false,"isCompanyStockFund":false,"isREITFund":false,"isVariableInsuranceFund":false,"isComingledTrustFund":false,"isConvertibleFund":false,"isAssetAllocationFund":false,"isStateMunicipalBond":false,"isNationalMunicipalBond":false,"isQualifiedOnly":false,"isPreciousMetalsFund":false,"mIsVIPSFund":false,"isSectorSpecific":false,"hasOtherIndex":false,"isTargetRetirementFund":false,"isRetirementSavingsTrustFund":false,"isNon40ActFund":false,"isUnfundedFund":false,"isCreditSuisseFund":false,"isKaiserFund":false,"isFundAccessFund":false,"isFundTransferableToVGI":false,"hasTransactionFee":false,"isNTFFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":true},"associatedFundIds":{"investorFundId":"1397","admiralFundId":"0127","etfFundId":"0936","institutionalFundId":"0137","institutionalPlusFundId":"1457"},"fundCategory":{"customizedHighCategoryName":"International","high":{"type":"HIGH","id":1,"name":"Stock Funds"},"mid":{"type":"MID","id":12,"name":"International/Global Stock"},"low":{"type":"LOW","id":1210,"name":"Foreign Large Blend"}}},"minimum":{"general":{"name":"General Account","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"ira":{"name":"IRA","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"ugma":{"name":"UGMA/UTMA","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"esa":{"name":"Education savings account","additional":"1"}},"risk":{"code":5,"level":"Aggressive","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices.
